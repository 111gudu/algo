This repo stands for journey of learning and experimenting algorithms.

I will put here the solutions of the questions at various websites and I am planning to use a different programming language for each website.

I have started with Java on Project Euler and EOlimp since Java is the language that I am confident most.

InterviewStreet, Spoj, TopCoder and UVA are my next goals. Summer is waiting for us!
